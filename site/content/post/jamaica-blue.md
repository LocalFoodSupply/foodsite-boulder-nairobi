Many food hubs function as simple points of transit for produce from the farmer to the purshaser. Facilitating a hub can help your budget by 10-15% depending upon the hub-farmer agreements reached.


## A well appreciated history of farms

Many farms are just waiting to come together into action. Good connection between farmers and the community.


## What you need to know before committing to running a hub

The community is depending upon you. By using this software you agree to treat other members with due respect, arrive on time, notify the group for changes or loss/ damage/ changes to any deliveries or dropoffs.  The network is here to help you in times of incliment weather, and to help you construct additional insulated or heated / cooled storage as necessary and designed with resource efficiency in mind.

## Roles: A food hub manager, producer, mentor, consumer, promoter
